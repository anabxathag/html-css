        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <pre>
            All the leaves have been fallen off
            The branches are small
            Burn the sky, clouds become ash
            Fireflies becomes a star

            What color is my sky painted?
            What color is your emotion?
            Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
            The bonfire is fading out

            Maybe we are falling
            Falling down with the rain
            Falling down, falling down
            Ah-ah-ah
            Ooh-ooh

            What color is my sky painted?
            What color is your emotion?
            Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
            The bonfire is fading out
            
            Maybe we are falling
            Falling down with the rain
            Falling down, falling down
            Ah-ah-ah
            Ooh-ooh
        </pre>
