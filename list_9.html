    <h3>Weirdest Foods</h3>
    <dl style="background-color: chocolate; border: 2px solid;">
        <dt>Century Egg, China</dt>
        <dd>=> Also known as hundred-year eggs or thousand-year eggs,
            century eggs are a Chinese egg-based culinary dish and an established delicacy.
            Suppose they didn't want to call it a rotten egg, although essentially that's what it is.
            It's made by preserving duck, chicken, or quail eggs in a mixture of clay, ash, and salt
            for months at a time - by which point the yolk has turned dark green or grey and has a potent sulfur smell.
            This might be one of the most bizarre foods you can taste in China.</dd>
        <dt>Casu Marzu, Italy</dt>
        <dd>=> Are you a fan of rare cheeses? Great, so what about rare cheeses infested with live maggots?
            Too far? Well, this next weird food reigns from Italy, so it must be good, right? Also known as “rotten
            cheese”,
            this Sardinian delicacy is called casu marzu and is made from Pecorino that is way past its expiration date.
            Then to make matters even weirder, the larvae of cheese flies (piophila casei) are added to the Pecorina,
            which then hatch inside, burrow around, digest the fats, and transform the product into a soft creamy
            cheese.
            You can choose to enjoy yours with or without the maggots.</dd>
        <dt>Stargazey Pie, England</dt>
        <dd>While this dish may come with a romantic-sounding name, it might not be one that will make an appearance
            at a date night dinner table. Also known as starry gazey pie, this weird food originates from a Cornish
            village
            called Mousehole in England. Traditionally served on the 23rd of December - the tale behind this dish
            might make it a bit more appetizing. Legend has it, one night in the 16th century, a heroic sailor rowed out
            one December
            evening during high storms and returned with a catch big enough to feed starving townsfolk. The Cornish pie
            is made by
            baking pilchards, eggs, and potatoes under a pastry crust - the key namesake factor is that the heads of the
            fish
            must poke out of the pie.</dd>
